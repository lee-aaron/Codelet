    <string name="getting_started_info">
        Java is just one of the many programming languages used in the massive world of code. This app is used to help teach Java to inexperienced users and to help understand the fundamentals of the coding language. Your efforts in reading and comprehending will lead to success. Throughout Codelet, you will find various lessons, examples, and tips on how to improve your Java programming ability.

        In order to compile Java programs, there are a multitude of tools that you can use. However, one of the more popular Java IDE’s (Integrated development environment), and also one that we personally recommend, is called “Eclipse.”
        \n\nEclipse Download: https://eclipse.org/downloads/
       \n\nIf you want to follow these lessons, you should download “Eclipse,” but any other compiler should do the job.
       \nWe hope that you find great use in our lessons. Good Luck!
    </string>

    <string name="hello_world_info">Welcome to the first lesson! We hope that you are as excited as we are. Now let’s create our first project. Once you open up Eclipse or any other compiler you downloaded, you will see a workspace folder, which is simply used for storing your programs.
       \n\nOnce you have opened up Eclipse, go to File -> New -> Java Project</string>

    <string name="hello_world_info2">Then name your Project: “First” and click Finish</string>

    <string name="hello_world_info3">After you create your project, right click, go to New and create a Class called “HelloWorld”. Then click Finish.</string>

    <string name="hello_world_info4">After you create your class, you should end up with an empty file with “public class HelloWorld”. \nInside the brackets, input the lines as shown below and compile your program with the green play button on the toolbar above. \nCongratulations, you have completed your first program!</string>

    <string name="hello_world_info5">Now… Let’s go into some detail about what is going on in this program. \nThe “public class HelloWorld portion of this code basically acts as an outline for the program. This should come with the creation of a new Java class and should be left alone. \nThe “public static void main (String []args)” portion is necessary for the program to run and pretty much declares that your program is running from that class. Inside the main class, we used “System.out.println” in order to print out the words “Hello World”. These descriptions are generalized as of now but we will go into more details on syntax in the next lesson.</string>
