        In order to compile Java programs, there are a multitude of tools that you can use. However, one of the more popular Java IDE’s (Integrated development environment), and also one that we personally recommend, is called “Eclipse.”
        \n\nEclipse Download: https://eclipse.org/downloads/
       \n\nIf you want to follow these lessons, you should download “Eclipse,” but any other compiler should do the job.
       \nWe hope that you find great use in our lessons. Good Luck!

    <string name="hello_world_info">Welcome to the first lesson! We hope that you are as excited as we are. Now let’s create our first project. Once you open up Eclipse or any other compiler you downloaded, you will see a workspace folder, which is simply used for storing your programs.
       \n\nOnce you have opened up Eclipse, go to File -> New -> Java Project</string>

    <string name="hello_world_info2">Then name your Project: “First” and click Finish</string>
